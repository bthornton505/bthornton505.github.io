<p>Hi Everybody! I am a fellow code newbie who has officially joined the Flatiron squad and hopes to one day become a professional developer! I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a degree in Radio/TV production and worked for the NBA right after graduation. I learned a lot from that job, the most important of which is realizing that tv production is not right for me. I found myself wanting more. Almost as if the career I had chosen was too easy. Hopefully with this blog, I can share with you my weekly discoveries, struggles, and overall emotions as I go through this challenging process. Enjoy!</p>
