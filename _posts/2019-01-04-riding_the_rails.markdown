Where to start...

I would love to write a super technical post about Rails and how this framework has really been a ton of fun to work with, but I can't lie, it has been the toughest thing I've had to learn in this program. I imagine that will change when I move onto Javascript and React but for now this has been quite the challenge.

Before I give you the full rant about Rails and its challenges, let me atleast explain my Rails portfolio app. 

The app I decided to make was an expense app for Uber/Lyft drivers to keep track of their montly expenses. This app would allow them to create expense reports for a given month which could then keep track of individual expenses accumulated throughout the month. They would also be able to use a search feature that would filter through all their expenses by year and give them the desired expenses based on the year they selected. 

I chose this app because I, myself, am an Uber/Lyft driver and since we are technically self-employed we need to do our own taxes. This app would allow driivers to consolidate all their expenses within one app which could then help them stay organized when tax season comes around. 

Building this app has been very challenging and honestly, a lot of that has to do with how I designed the functionality of this app. It's not all my fault though. After learning Sinatra and breezing through my Sinatra app, I found the learning curve to be quite steep when the magic of Rails was brought into the picture. Don't get me wrong, I love the magic that Rails provides and I really can't wait to play around with this framework with some side projects, but damn did it make some features tough to build.

By far the hardest thing to build was my nested form that built a new expense. I wanted to be able to submit a new expense that also created a new comment (separate object) and a category that was associated with the expense (also a separate object). It took quite some time to really play around pry but after a week of pulling my hair out, I finally made it work. Oh how I love that feeling...

All-in-all, working on this app has been the hardest challenge so far, but I would also say it's been the most rewarding. My ability to google has gotten a serious upgrade, which honestly makes a huge difference, and I really have learned that I have what it takes to make this a life-long career (I hope).
