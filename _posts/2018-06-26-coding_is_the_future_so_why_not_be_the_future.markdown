The road that led me to coding was definitely not the clearest, which I feel makes it that much more interesting (at least for me lol). Before I start let me give you alittle back story about me...

About two years ago I graduated from the University of Central Florida (aka UCF "The National Champs") with a degree in Radio/TV production. Essentially my degree involved video production and all aspects of creating video content. This is a field I discovered in high school and I really did enjoy everything I learned. 

After graduation I accepted a job in New Jersey, working for the NBA (yes the NBA, as in professional basketball) as a camera assistant and production assistant. This was my "Dream Job". I had achieved exactly what I wanted when I had dreamed up my ideal career which was in sports production and it really was a cool job. I was given the opportunity to travel all over the U.S. watching the best basketball players in person, but it came with its big downsides.

I had moved to Jersey with my Fiancee, now wife, who was also from Florida and the traveling took me away from her quite a bit. For the first year this was a big change for us but not impossible. Then this past New Years we found out we would be expecting a new family memember. We would be blessed with bringing a baby into the world! Nothing could make us happier, except that my job made life not so easy. I was already feeling unsatisfied at my job and this news really forced me to look at my priorities. My dream had given me some great moments on the road, but I quickly realized that this was not for me. 

At a certain point I had a realization that basketball would not fullfill my life and so I started looking for what I truly was passionate about in life. I wanted to create something, to make a difference in the world. I though about going back to get my masters in biology so that I could work with the environment or animals, but going back to school takes too long and costs way too much. I know I'm not the only one with student loans. This brought me back to square one, until a weird chain of events threw me for a loop. My wife and I found out we would be getting kicked out of our apartment that we had fallen in love with and I was speechless to be honest. My wife however, knew exactly the answer.

 Lets move to Denver! This is something we had been planning for the past year and now seemed like the perfect opportunity. We moved to Jersey for a job that left me wanting more and wife was unhappy with the lifestyle that came with being so close to Manhattan. Moving to Colorado would give us the laid back, clean living lifestyle we had always envisioned. 
 
 This doesn't explain why I decided to code. After this news I left for a business trip and during this trip I had a thought cross my mind which had been somewhat reoccuring the past year, "I wonder what programming would be like?", except this time I acted on it. I immediately googled "How to become a computer programmer without a degree" and to my surprise, there was A LOT of resources! I was beyond excited and the first link I clicked on was a blog that eventually led me to a hyperlink for the Flatiron School. Within 10 minutes I discovered that they had a free prep course and so I dove right in. 

Along with this reoccuring thought, I have also had the conversation with my wife about teaching our kids how to program from a young age. I would always speak highly of this idea and frequently express it by declaring that "Coding is the Future!", so when I discovered the Flatiron School, I knew something was clicking. I knew this was something I needed to pursue. I finally realized that instead of just declaring that "Coding is the Future!" I needed to BE the future!
